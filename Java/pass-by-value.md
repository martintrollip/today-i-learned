## Pass by value

All object references in Java are passed by value. This means that a copy of the value will be passed to a method. 


But the Java object variables are simply references that point to real objects in the memory heap. Therefore, even though Java passes parameters to methods by value, if the variable points to an object reference, the real object will also be changed if a method updates it.
