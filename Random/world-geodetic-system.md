## World Geodetic System

WGS84 (WGS 1984) is an Earth-centered, Earth-fixed terrestrial reference system and geodetic datum. WGS84 is based on a consistent set of constants and model parameters that describe the Earth's size, shape, and gravity and geomagnetic fields.

It is used for cartography, geodesy and satellite navigation including GPS.

The Location services on Android makes use of this to determine the distance between two coordinates.
