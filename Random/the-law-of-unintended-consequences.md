## The law of unintended consequences

In the social sciences, unintended consequences (sometimes unanticipated consequences or unforeseen consequences) are outcomes of a purposeful action that are not intended or foreseen. The term was popularised in the twentieth century by American sociologist Robert K. Merton.

There's many types of unintended consequences.

An example of the perverse result (or the Cobra effect) is when the action has to opposite result of what you were aiming for; 

There is no real evidence of this story, but it's interesting to think about. In British India there were to many Cobras.  So the British put a bounty on dead Cobras. Basically kill a Cobra, bring it in and get your money.  People got smart and started farming Cobras, and when they relised this, they stopped the bounty.   And then the farmers simple let all their Cobras into the wild, so now there's even more.
