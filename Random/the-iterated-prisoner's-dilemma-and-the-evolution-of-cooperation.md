## The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma and The Evolution of Cooperation

The prisoner's dilemma is a paradox in decision analysis in which two individuals acting in their own self-interests do not produce the optimal outcome. The typical prisoner's dilemma is set up in such a way that both parties choose to protect themselves at the expense of the other participant. As a result, both participants find themselves in a worse state than if they had cooperated with each other in the decision-making process. The prisoner's dilemma is one of the most well-known concepts in modern game theory.

The Irritated prisoners delemma is the same game played multiple times against the same oponent, so you can learn their behaviour, 

The best strategy is Tit-for-Tat.  Basically start of being nice, and then if your openent is not, retaliate.  If they're nice again, you can be nice again.
