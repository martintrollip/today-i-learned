## The LEGO City Deep Space Rocket won't leave orbit

The LEGO City Deep Space Rocket's measurements can be determined by using a standard LEGO minifugure as a reference.  Assuming the minifigure is an average American adult, we have 3 block = 1.753m.  

The main stage would be 11.69m tall and 3.51m wide, the SRB is 7.60m tall and 2.34m wide, the payload is 7.01m tall and 3.51m wide and the capsule is 10.52m tall and 4.86m wide.

some guy's blog plugged this into the equations and found that this spaceship won't reach orbit.
