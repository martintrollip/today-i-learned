## SpaceX Engineering

Software engineering consists of 4 teams, Flight Software, Enterprise Information (C#/MVC4/EF/SQL; Javascript/Knockout/Handlebars/LESS/etc and REST API), Groung Software (LabVIEW) and Avionics. 

Their systems have a tripple redundancy.

The software is certified and one example is Software Considerations in Airbone Systems and Equipment, DO178B. The codee is verified with tools such as Astr√©e and statically analysed for runtime errors and concurrency bugs. Lots of mission critical software is therefor written in C.

The flight interface in Dragon 2 runs on Chromium and JavaScript with 100% code coverage. The touch screens is backed by physical buttons.
