## Transactions

A transaction is a sequence of operations performed (using one or more SQL statements) on a database as a single logical unit of work. The effects of all the SQL statements in a transaction can be either all committed (applied to the database) or all rolled back (undone from the database).

This can save you from making unintended changes to the database and the `onosecond` as in `The Worst Typo I Ever Made` below.
