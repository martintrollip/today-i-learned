## Flavor dimensions

When building the app, Gradle combines a product flavor configuration from each flavor dimension we define, along with a build type configuration, to create the final build variant. Gradle does not combine product flavors that belong to the same flavor dimension.

You can also create a src folder for a flavour variant,  eg if you have a `client` dimension and a `services` dimension you can create a folder named `client1Service1` and `client1Service2` if you need specific code only for `client1`.
