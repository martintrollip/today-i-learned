## API difference report

You can view the differences between the previous API level by using the [Android API Differences Report](https://developer.android.com/sdk/api_diff/r-dp4/changes). 

Update the URL to the relevant API for which you need to check differences. In the example `r-dp4` stands for Android **R** and **developer preview 4**.   This can be replaced with the API eg **29** if you wish to compare API 28 and 29 for example.
